            <p class="case-study-tagline">AI companion designed to provide elderly users with engaging conversation,
                assistance, and companionship.</p>
            <p class="case-study-intro">GrannyAI focuses on creating meaningful interactions for elderly users through
                natural conversation, memory assistance, and daily support features. Designed with accessibility and
                warmth at its core, this project aims to combat loneliness and provide practical assistance to seniors.

        <!-- My Role -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>As the lead designer and developer on this project, I'm responsible for the entire product lifecycle—from
                initial concept and user research through design, development, and testing. My focus is on creating an
                empathetic, accessible interface that feels warm and human, while building the technical infrastructure
                to support natural language conversations and memory retention.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>User research and persona development for elderly users</li>
                <li>UX/UI design with focus on accessibility and simplicity</li>
                <li>Voice interaction design and conversational flow</li>
                <li>Full-stack development and AI integration</li>
                <li>Testing and iteration with target user group</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- The Challenge -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <h3>Designing for Dignity and Connection</h3>
            <p>Loneliness among elderly populations is a growing crisis, with studies showing that social isolation can
                be as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Many seniors struggle with technology, making existing AI
                assistants inaccessible or frustrating to use.</p>
            <p>The challenge is to create an AI companion that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Feels genuinely warm and empathetic, not robotic or transactional</li>
                <li>Is accessible to users with limited tech experience or physical limitations</li>
                <li>Respects the dignity and intelligence of elderly users</li>
                <li>Provides real value beyond simple conversation—memory assistance, medication reminders, family
                    connection</li>
                <li>Maintains privacy and security of sensitive personal information</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- The Approach -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <h3>Human-Centered AI Design</h3>
            <p>Rather than building another generic chatbot, I'm approaching this as a relationship design problem. The
                AI needs to feel like a trusted companion—someone who remembers your stories, understands your needs,
                and genuinely cares.</p>
            <p>Key principles guiding the design:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Voice-first interaction</strong> - Natural conversation, not typing or tapping</li>
                <li><strong>Patience and clarity</strong> - No rushing, no jargon, clear feedback</li>
                <li><strong>Memory and continuity</strong> - Remembers conversations, preferences, and important details
                </li>
                <li><strong>Proactive assistance</strong> - Gentle reminders and helpful suggestions</li>
                <li><strong>Warmth in every interaction</strong> - Tone, pacing, and personality that feels caring</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Current Progress -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Current Progress</h2>
            <h3>Building the Foundation</h3>
            <p>I'm currently in the development phase, building the core software infrastructure. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Natural language processing pipeline for understanding conversational context</li>
                <li>Memory system for storing and retrieving personal information and conversation history</li>
                <li>Voice synthesis with warm, natural-sounding speech patterns</li>
                <li>Reminder and scheduling system for medications and appointments</li>
                <li>Family connection features for sharing updates and photos</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The technical architecture prioritizes reliability and privacy, with all personal data encrypted and
                stored locally when possible.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Next Steps -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>Once the core software is complete, I'll move into extensive testing with real users from the target
                demographic. This will involve:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Usability testing with seniors of varying tech comfort levels</li>
                <li>Iterating on conversation flows based on real interactions</li>
                <li>Refining the personality and tone to feel authentic and caring</li>
                <li>Testing accessibility features with users who have vision or hearing limitations</li>
                <li>Gathering feedback from family members and caregivers</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Full case study with detailed design process, user research findings, and impact metrics will be
                    published upon project completion.</em></p>
