                2025</span>
            <p class="case-study-tagline">AI-powered smart trash bin that uses computer vision and natural language to
                classify waste in real time.</p>
            <p class="case-study-intro">Built in 36 hours at Emory Hacks 2025, TossWise is a hands-free system that
                identifies waste, guides disposal through voice feedback, and adapts to location-specific bin
                configurations. The project won Best Use of Gemini API for its innovative application of Google's
                multimodal AI.</p>

        <!-- My Role -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>As the UX designer and computer vision specialist on the team, I was responsible for the user experience
                design, visual feedback systems, and improving the object detection pipeline. I worked alongside
                teammates to create a seamless, intuitive waste sorting experience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed the live trash falling animation and UI feedback system</li>
                <li>Created the contamination percentage display for user education</li>
                <li>Improved detection accuracy using trained Roboflow model</li>
                <li>Developed adaptive onboarding system for different bin configurations</li>
                <li>Integrated YOLOv8 with Roboflow for enhanced object detection</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- The Challenge -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <h3>Making Recycling Effortless and Accurate</h3>
            <p>Contamination is the biggest problem in recycling—when people put the wrong items in recycling bins,
                entire batches can be rejected and sent to landfills. Studies show that up to 25% of recycling is
                contaminated, costing cities millions and undermining environmental efforts.</p>
            <p>The challenge was to create a system that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accurately identifies waste types in real-time, even with varying lighting and angles</li>
                <li>Provides immediate, clear guidance without requiring user input</li>
                <li>Works hands-free to maintain hygiene</li>
                <li>Adapts to different bin configurations (2-bin, 3-bin, 4-bin systems)</li>
                <li>Educates users about contamination without being preachy</li>
                <li>Completes the entire interaction in under 3 seconds</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- The Approach -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <h3>Multimodal AI + Delightful Feedback</h3>
            <p>We combined computer vision, AI classification, and voice guidance to create a seamless experience. The
                key insight was that users need both visual and audio feedback—visual to confirm what the system "sees"
                and audio to guide action without looking at a screen.</p>

            <h3>Technical Architecture</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>YOLOv8 Person Detection</strong> - Triggers the system when someone approaches with waste
                </li>
                <li><strong>Roboflow-Trained Model</strong> - Custom-trained to recognize common waste items and improve
                    accuracy</li>
                <li><strong>Google Gemini Vision API</strong> - Classifies waste type and provides reasoning</li>
                <li><strong>ElevenLabs TTS</strong> - Natural voice guidance ("Please place in recycling bin")</li>
                <li><strong>Arduino Integration</strong> - Controls bin lids and physical feedback</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- The Discovery -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Discovery</h2>
            <h3>Understanding User Behavior</h3>
            <p>Through observation and testing, we discovered several key insights:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users need confirmation that the system "saw" their item—hence the live camera feed</li>
                <li>Audio guidance is more effective than visual alone when hands are full</li>
                <li>People want to know WHY something goes in a particular bin (education opportunity)</li>
                <li>Bin configurations vary widely by location—system needs to be adaptable</li>
                <li>Speed is critical—any delay over 3 seconds feels frustrating</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Detailed Design -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Detailed Design</h2>

            <h3>Live Trash Falling Animation</h3>
            <p>One of my key contributions was designing the visual feedback system. When the AI classifies an item, the
                UI shows an animation of the trash falling into the correct bin. This serves multiple purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Confirms the system processed the request</li>
                <li>Visually reinforces which bin to use</li>
                <li>Creates a satisfying, game-like interaction</li>
                <li>Reduces perceived wait time during processing</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Contamination Percentage Display</h3>
            <p>To educate users without lecturing, I designed a contamination percentage indicator that shows how well
                the facility is doing overall. This:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creates awareness about the contamination problem</li>
                <li>Gamifies correct sorting (users want to improve the percentage)</li>
                <li>Provides positive reinforcement when percentage improves</li>
                <li>Builds community around environmental responsibility</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Adaptive Onboarding System</h3>
            <p>Different locations have different bin configurations. I created an onboarding flow that lets
                administrators configure the system for their specific setup:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2-bin system (trash, recycling)</li>
                <li>3-bin system (trash, recycling, compost)</li>
                <li>4-bin system (trash, recycling, compost, glass)</li>
                <li>Custom configurations for specialized facilities</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Refinement -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Refinement</h2>
            <h3>Improving Detection Accuracy</h3>
            <p>Initial tests showed that generic object detection models struggled with waste items, especially when
                partially obscured or at odd angles. I addressed this by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Training a custom Roboflow model on 500+ images of common waste items</li>
                <li>Integrating YOLOv8 for faster, more accurate person and object detection</li>
                <li>Creating a two-stage pipeline: YOLOv8 for initial detection, Gemini Vision for classification</li>
                <li>Adding confidence thresholds to request re-positioning if uncertain</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These improvements increased classification accuracy from ~70% to ~92% in our testing.</p>

        <!-- The Impact -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Impact</h2>
            <h3>Award-Winning Innovation</h3>
            <p>TossWise won Best Use of Gemini API at Emory Hacks 2025, with judges praising the practical application
                of multimodal AI and the thoughtful UX design. The project demonstrated how AI can solve real
                environmental problems while creating delightful user experiences.</p>

            <h3>Key Achievements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>92% classification accuracy in testing</li>
                <li>Average interaction time under 2.5 seconds</li>
                <li>Positive user feedback on the visual feedback system</li>
                <li>Adaptable to any bin configuration</li>
                <li>Won Best Use of Gemini API at Emory Hacks 2025</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>This project reinforced the importance of immediate, multimodal feedback in physical computing
                applications. Users need to see, hear, and feel that the system is working. The combination of visual
                animation, voice guidance, and physical bin movement created a complete, satisfying interaction that
                made waste sorting feel effortless.</p>
