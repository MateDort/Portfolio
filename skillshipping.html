        <!-- My Role -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>As the sole designer and developer, I was responsible for the complete product vision, design, and
                implementation. My focus was on creating truly adaptive learning that feels personalized without being
                obvious about the algorithms behind it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed adaptive learning system with invisible intelligence—users feel personalized content
                    without seeing the algorithm</li>
                <li>Created enhanced reading format with rhythm, pacing, ASCII diagrams, and micro-hooks that increased
                    content engagement</li>
                <li>Built intelligent project grading with multi-format support (PDF, DOCX, images), GPT Vision
                    integration, and robust score extraction</li>
                <li>Implemented hybrid adaptive system with real-time learning analysis and gap-focused content</li>
                <li>Built multi-layer file reading with ~90% success rate across formats</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- The Challenge -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <h3>Making Learning Truly Adaptive</h3>
            <p>Most "adaptive" learning platforms are just branching quizzes—if you get a question wrong, you see more
                questions on that topic. True adaptation means understanding how each person learns best and
                continuously adjusting content, pacing, and difficulty in real-time.</p>
            <p>The challenge was to create a system that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adapts content based on learning patterns, not just quiz scores</li>
                <li>Feels personalized without being creepy or obvious</li>
                <li>Generates engaging content that doesn't feel AI-written</li>
                <li>Grades real projects (PDFs, documents, images) with meaningful feedback</li>
                <li>Works across different learning styles and goals</li>
                <li>Maintains engagement over weeks or months of learning</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- The Approach -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <h3>Invisible Intelligence</h3>
            <p>The key insight was that the best adaptive systems are invisible. Users shouldn't think "this AI is
                adapting to me"—they should just feel like the content is perfectly suited to their needs.</p>

            <h3>User Flows</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Onboarding:</strong> Welcome → Skill Input → Level Selection → Duration Preference → Goal
                    Setting → Content Type Preferences → Course Generation (30-60s)</li>
                <li><strong>Learning Loop:</strong> Course Screen → 'Up Next' Ribbon → Lecture Screen
                    (Reading/Quiz/Project) → Completion & Feedback → Next Content Generation (Adaptive) → Loop continues
                </li>
                <li><strong>Project Grading:</strong> Project Screen → Upload Files (PDF/DOCX/Images) → File Preview →
                    Grade Project → Processing → Results (Pass/Fail, Score, Feedback) → Re-grade if needed</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Invisible intelligence:</strong> Adaptive system works behind scenes—users experience
                    content that 'just feels right' without seeing complex algorithms</li>
                <li><strong>Progressive disclosure:</strong> Single-page onboarding with visual progress, advanced
                    features (Learning DNA, 3D Map) unlock after engagement</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced reading format:</strong> Short paragraphs, strategic whitespace, ASCII diagrams,
                    micro-hooks, conversational tone—feels like discovery, not homework</li>
                <li><strong>Real project grading:</strong> Native file pickers, GPT Vision for images, detailed feedback
                    showing what GPT 'saw', re-grade option reduces anxiety</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- The Framework -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Framework</h2>
            <h3>ComprehensiveLearningTracker</h3>
            <p>The heart of SkillShipping is the ComprehensiveLearningTracker, which analyzes every interaction to build
                a complete picture of how each user learns:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tracks quiz performance, reading time, content preferences, and struggle points</li>
                <li>Identifies knowledge gaps and misconceptions</li>
                <li>Builds personalized GPT prompts for next content generation</li>
                <li>Validates that generated content aligns with learning goals</li>
                <li>Adjusts difficulty and pacing based on progress patterns</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Multi-Layer File Reading</h3>
            <p>To grade real projects, I built a robust file reading system with multiple fallback layers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Layer 1:</strong> Direct text extraction for simple formats</li>
                <li><strong>Layer 2:</strong> PDFLib for binary PDFs and complex documents</li>
                <li><strong>Layer 3:</strong> Smart filename analysis when content can't be extracted</li>
                <li><strong>GPT Vision:</strong> Base64 image encoding for visual content analysis</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This achieves ~90% success rate across all file types.</p>

            <h3>Technical Architecture</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React Native 0.81.4, Expo ~54.0.12, TypeScript 5.9.2</li>
                <li><strong>AI Services:</strong> OpenAI GPT-4, GPT-4o (Vision), Whisper API</li>
                <li><strong>File Processing:</strong> expo-document-picker, expo-image-picker, expo-file-system/legacy,
                    react-native-pdf-lib</li>
                <li><strong>Database:</strong> Expo SQLite 16.0.8 with learning_sessions, ai_interactions,
                    quiz_attempts, project_submissions, user_progress tables</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Detailed Design -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Detailed Design</h2>

            <h3>Enhanced Reading Format</h3>
            <p>Generic AI-generated content feels robotic and boring. I designed an enhanced reading format that makes
                learning feel like discovery:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rhythm and pacing:</strong> Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences), varied sentence length,
                    strategic whitespace</li>
                <li><strong>ASCII diagrams:</strong> Simple text-based visuals that explain concepts without images</li>
                <li><strong>Micro-hooks:</strong> Questions and teasers that pull readers forward</li>
                <li><strong>Conversational tone:</strong> Second person ("you"), contractions, relatable examples</li>
                <li><strong>Progressive complexity:</strong> Start simple, build to advanced concepts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This increased content engagement by 40% in testing.</p>

            <h3>Intelligent Project Grading</h3>
            <p>One of the most challenging features was grading real project submissions. The system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accepts PDFs, DOCX files, and images</li>
                <li>Extracts content using multi-layer reading system</li>
                <li>Uses GPT Vision to analyze images and visual content</li>
                <li>Provides detailed feedback on what was good and what needs improvement</li>
                <li>Shows users exactly what GPT "saw" for transparency</li>
                <li>Allows re-grading if users disagree with the assessment</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Score Extraction System</h3>
            <p>GPT returns free-form text, not structured data. I built a robust score extraction system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multi-pattern regex parsing to find scores in various formats</li>
                <li>80% pass/fail threshold with clear communication</li>
                <li>Comprehensive error handling for ambiguous responses</li>
                <li>Fallback to manual review if confidence is low</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Refinement -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Refinement</h2>
            <h3>Making Adaptation Truly Invisible</h3>
            <p>Early testing revealed that users felt uncomfortable when they could "see" the adaptation happening.
                Comments like "it's creepy how it knows I'm struggling" indicated I needed to make the intelligence more
                subtle.</p>
            <p>Refinements included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Removing explicit "adapting to you" messaging</li>
                <li>Introducing variety in content even when focusing on gaps</li>
                <li>Spacing out difficulty adjustments so they feel natural</li>
                <li>Framing recommendations as suggestions, not prescriptions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After these changes, users described the experience as "perfectly paced" without attributing it to AI.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- The Impact -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Impact</h2>
            <h3>Key Achievements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>40% increase in content engagement with enhanced reading format</li>
                <li>~90% success rate for file reading across all formats</li>
                <li>Real-time adaptive content generation based on learning patterns</li>
                <li>Intelligent project grading with GPT Vision integration</li>
                <li>Users describe experience as "perfectly paced" without realizing it's AI-driven</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>This project taught me that the best AI experiences are the ones users don't consciously notice. When
                adaptation is too obvious, it feels invasive. When it's invisible, it feels magical—like the content was
                made just for you. The key is designing systems that enhance the experience without calling attention to
                themselves. Also, building robust file handling with multiple fallback layers is essential for
                real-world applications where users will throw every possible file format at your system.</p>
