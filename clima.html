            <p class="case-study-tagline">Precision agriculture platform that helps farmers make smarter decisions using
                NASA technology.</p>
            <p class="case-study-intro">Built in 48 hours at HackATL 2025 with teammates Brody Weinfurtner, Jack Bashaw,
                and Leah Loukedis. C.L.I.M.A combines two NASA technologies to provide hyper-local, data-driven insights
                that help farmers optimize irrigation, fertilizer, and planting strategies while preparing for climate
                challenges.</p>

        <!-- My Role -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>As the product designer on the team, I was responsible for the complete app design in Figma, user flow
                development, and translating complex NASA satellite data into farmer-friendly insights. I also
                contributed to the MVP React web app development.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed full app interface in Figma for precision agriculture use case</li>
                <li>Created intuitive dashboard for visualizing NASA satellite data</li>
                <li>Built user flows that translate complex NASA tech into actionable insights</li>
                <li>Developed MVP React web app to demonstrate the concept</li>
                <li>Presented the product vision to judges and stakeholders</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- The Challenge -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <h3>Making NASA Technology Accessible to Farmers</h3>
            <p>Climate change is creating unprecedented challenges for farmers—unpredictable weather patterns, shifting
                growing seasons, and increased extreme weather events. While NASA has powerful satellite technology that
                could help, it's largely inaccessible to the people who need it most.</p>
            <p>The challenge was to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make complex NASA satellite data understandable and actionable for farmers</li>
                <li>Provide hyper-local insights (field-level, not just regional)</li>
                <li>Deliver recommendations that fit into existing farming workflows</li>
                <li>Build trust with a user base that may be skeptical of technology</li>
                <li>Design for users who may have limited tech experience or connectivity</li>
                <li>Complete a working prototype in 48 hours for the hackathon</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- The Approach -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <h3>Insights Over Data</h3>
            <p>Rather than overwhelming farmers with raw satellite imagery and weather data, we focused on providing
                clear, actionable insights. The key was understanding how farmers think about their land and what
                decisions they need to make.</p>

            <h3>NASA Technologies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HSEG (Hierarchical Segmentation Engine)</strong> - Provides pixel-level farmland
                    segmentation into distinct soil and crop zones, allowing farmers to see variations across their
                    fields</li>
                <li><strong>MERRA/AS & Climate Analytics as a Service</strong> - Delivers weather pattern forecasting
                    and climate trend analysis for long-term planning</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Design Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Zone-based thinking</strong> - Match how farmers mentally divide their land</li>
                <li><strong>Action-oriented</strong> - Every insight leads to a clear next step</li>
                <li><strong>Visual-first</strong> - Maps and charts over tables and numbers</li>
                <li><strong>Progressive disclosure</strong> - Summary first, details on demand</li>
                <li><strong>Offline-capable</strong> - Work without constant connectivity</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- The Discovery -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Discovery</h2>
            <h3>Understanding Farmer Workflows</h3>
            <p>Through research and conversations with farming stakeholders, we identified key decision points where
                C.L.I.M.A could provide value:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Irrigation planning</strong> - When and where to water based on soil moisture and weather
                    forecasts</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilizer application</strong> - Which zones need nutrients and how much</li>
                <li><strong>Planting strategy</strong> - Optimal timing and crop selection based on climate trends</li>
                <li><strong>Harvest planning</strong> - Predicting yield and timing based on growth patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Climate adaptation</strong> - Long-term planning for shifting weather patterns</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Detailed Design -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Detailed Design</h2>

            <h3>Dashboard Layout</h3>
            <p>The dashboard prioritizes actionable insights over raw data. At a glance, farmers see:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Current field conditions with zone-by-zone breakdown</li>
                <li>Immediate action items (e.g., "Zone 3 needs irrigation within 48 hours")</li>
                <li>7-day weather forecast with impact on field operations</li>
                <li>Long-term climate trends affecting planting decisions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Zone-Based Interface</h3>
            <p>Using HSEG segmentation data, the interface divides farmland into distinct zones based on soil
                composition, moisture levels, and crop health. This matches how farmers naturally think about their
                land—not as a uniform field, but as areas with different characteristics and needs.</p>

            <h3>Recommendation System</h3>
            <p>Rather than just showing data, C.L.I.M.A provides specific recommendations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Zone 2 shows low nitrogen levels - apply 40 lbs/acre"</li>
                <li>"Forecast shows rain in 3 days - delay irrigation in Zones 1 and 4"</li>
                <li>"Climate trends suggest shifting corn planting 2 weeks earlier next season"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Visual Data Representation</h3>
            <p>All data is presented visually through maps, heat maps, and simple charts. Color coding makes it easy to
                spot problem areas at a glance. Detailed numbers are available on tap for those who want them.</p>

        <!-- The Framework -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Framework</h2>
            <h3>Technical Architecture</h3>
            <p>We built an MVP React web app that demonstrates the integration of NASA technologies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>NASA HSEG API integration for field segmentation</li>
                <li>NASA MERRA/AS API for climate and weather data</li>
                <li>Data processing pipeline to convert satellite imagery into actionable insights</li>
                <li>React frontend with responsive design for mobile and desktop</li>
                <li>Map visualization using satellite imagery overlays</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- The Impact -->
        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Impact</h2>
            <h3>2nd Place at HackATL 2025</h3>
            <p>C.L.I.M.A won 2nd place at HackATL 2025 in the NASA Technology Transfer Program track. Judges praised the
                practical application of NASA technology and the thoughtful UX design that made complex data accessible.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Achievements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Successfully integrated two NASA technologies into cohesive platform</li>
                <li>Created complete Figma design system in 48 hours</li>
                <li>Built working MVP demonstrating core functionality</li>
                <li>Received positive feedback from agricultural stakeholders</li>
                <li>Won 2nd Place at HackATL 2025</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>This project taught me the importance of designing for domain experts who aren't tech experts. Farmers
                are incredibly knowledgeable about their craft, but may not be familiar with satellite imagery or
                climate analytics. The key was respecting their expertise while making technology accessible—providing
                insights, not just data, and matching their mental models of how they think about their land.</p>
